# SudokuSolverDFS
This is a sudokuSolver using DFS for my honors assignment for ECE 264. Given a unsolved proper sudoku puzzle, it will output the solved puzzle in a output textfile. To run the code input a sudoku input file and a sudoku output file. Given that, it will read input sudoku file and perform a depthFirstSolve to find the solution. After finding a solution, the program writes the solution to the output file.
